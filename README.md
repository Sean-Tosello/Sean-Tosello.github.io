# My Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website which I built to convey my technical skills with front-end engineering. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and utilizes custom Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 

## Significant Features

- Page load animation simulating a room (the webpage) lighting up. 
- Transitions for hovering and active buttons.
- Event listeners that ensure only one button overlay is active at a time.
- Full responsiveness for any standard desktop, tablet, or mobile viewport.

### What makes it stand out?

- Noire/Grayscale theming with colorization animations when interacting with elements
- Responsive buttons that use custom layering rather than standardized box-shadowing to simulate their appearance
- Use of conic-gradients to simulate light fixtures in a dark room
- One page structure for all material that makes all of my portfolio materials and experience accessible
- Custom media queries to ensure website responsiveness across an array of devices
